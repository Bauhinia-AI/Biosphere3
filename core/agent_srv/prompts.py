    Consider the following explanations about the game systems:

    **Health System:**
    - Each day, there is a chance to get sick, reducing health by varying amounts depending on the illness.
    - Visiting a doctor restores +10 health but costs 100 coins.
    - No illness will occur in the first 14 game days.
    - The health efficiency multiplier is min(100, health)/100.

    **Hunger System:**
    - Hunger decreases over time, reducing by 10% of the maximum hunger every hour.
    - When absolute hunger is below 50, production efficiency = hunger/100.

    **Energy System:**
    - Energy decreases when performing various activities.
    - Sleeping restores 10% of energy per hour.
    - During production activities, efficiency multiplier = max(energy, 100)/100.

    Different accommodations affect maximum energy, health, hunger, and energy recovery rates.

    Considering the user's financial status, needs, these game mechanics, and the previous failed attempts, decide on the accommodation and lease duration.

    Your output should be a JSON object like:
